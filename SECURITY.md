# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the `main` branch. Please base vulnerability reports on the latest commit.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Create a private security advisory on GitHub (Security > Advisories > Report a vulnerability) **or**
2. Email the maintainers via the address listed in the repository owner profile.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept if available.
- Any recommended mitigation ideas.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **5 business days**. Once the issue is confirmed:

- We will develop and test a fix.
- A coordinated disclosure timeline will be agreed upon with the reporter.
- Credits will be granted upon request after the fix is released.

## Preferred Practices for Reporters

- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly before an official fix is released.
- Avoid accessing or modifying data that does not belong to you.
- Avoid actions that could degrade the service for other users.

Thank you for helping us keep DevStudy AI Suite secure.
